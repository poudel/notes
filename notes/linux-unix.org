** GitHub clone

GitHub clone by just running ~gh username/repo~ command. I don't use
this anymore since I use ~magit~. Just keeping moving it here from
somewhere else for posterity.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gh () {
    if [ ! $1 ]; then
        echo "Pass repo url or github repo in this format: <username>/<repo>"
        return 1
    fi

    if [[ $1 == http* ]] || [[ $1 == git@* ]]
    then
        git clone $1 $2
    else
        git clone "https://github.com/$1" $2
    fi
}

** Nginx logs

Print logs in ~26.29.22.77 "GET /project/ 200~ format. 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1 " " $6 " " $7 " " $9'

** Adjusting brightness the hard way

Not exactly a shell script. I wanted to write some C and I was having
trouble with the brightness settings in KDE power management. I wrote
this to run from the command line. I used it for a few months. That is
how long it took me to figure out that I had not installed
~powerdevil~. This is here for posterity as well.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

/* Adjust brightness in linux

`./bright` Print current brightness
`sudo ./bright <number>` Set the brightness to any arbitrary number
`sudo ./bright d` Set brightness to 300 (for the day)
`sudo ./bright n` Set brightness to 150 (for the night)

*/

int main (int argc, char** cx){

  int count;
  char* brightness;
  FILE * fp;

  char filepath[] = "/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness";


  if (argc == 1){

    fp = fopen(filepath, "r");

    if (fp) {
      printf("Current brightness: ");
      while ((count = getc(fp)) != EOF){
	putchar(count);
      }
    }

  } else {

    if (geteuid() != 0){
      printf("Need to run this as root!\n");
      return 0;
    }

    if (strcmp(cx[1], "d") == 0){
      brightness = "300";
    } else if (strcmp(cx[1], "n") == 0) {
      brightness = "150";
    } else {
      brightness = cx[1];
    }

    fp = fopen(filepath, "w");
    fprintf(fp, brightness);
    printf("Successfully set brightness to: %s\n", brightness);
  }

  fclose(fp);

  return 0;
